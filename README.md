Project

Studio Ghibli Fan Page (SPA - single page application)

Description

Users can click on a movie title to see a list of characters from that movie, add a new character, delete a character, see a character's detail information, add likes to a character, and submit comments

Motivation

This is our Module 3 project for Flatiron School, wherein we learned how to use Javascript to manipulate the DOM without a page reload, how to build and incorporate a back-end API using Ruby on Rails, and communicate with our front-end, which uses JS, HTML and CSS.

Dependencies

The front-end files for this project are stored in a separate repository, which can be found here:
https://github.com/carolinesoleelee/studio_ghibli_frontend

Database: Postgresql

Ruby Version: This application uses Ruby 2.3.3, and the following gems:

- gem 'active_model_serializers'
- gem 'rails', '~> 5.2.1'
- gem 'rack-cors'

Deployment

- run bundle install from your terminal to install all gems
- run Postgresql on your machine
- run 'rails db:create' from your terminal, then
- run 'rails db:migrate'
- run 'rails db:seed'
