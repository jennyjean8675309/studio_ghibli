Character.create(name: 'No-Face (Kaonashi)', image_url: 'https://media.giphy.com/media/hXYlYBixtHEFq/giphy.gif', likes: 0, description: 'No-Face appeared in a semi-transparent state while shifting in and out of visibility. His organs are visible, pulsating in several states. His figure resembles that of a long, black tube. While it is unknown if No-Face has a physical body, it is shown that he can develop arms and legs with the capability of leaving footprints as he walks. An ominous, expressionless mask with grey-violet highlights is painted on his “head” of sorts, and while there is a “mouth” painted on the mask, No-Face has shown that his real, expertly-hidden mouth is larger than the one present on his mask.', movie_id: 1, quote: "Want some gold? I'm not giving it to anyone else.", abilities: 'Can ingest matter in all forms', species: 'Spirit', personality: 'He becomes extremely volatile after being fed.')
