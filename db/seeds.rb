Character.create(name: 'No-Face (Kaonashi)', image_url: 'https://media.giphy.com/media/hXYlYBixtHEFq/giphy.gif', likes: 0, description: 'No-Face appeared in a semi-transparent state while shifting in and out of visibility. His organs are visible, pulsating in several states. His figure resembles that of a long, black tube. While it is unknown if No-Face has a physical body, it is shown that he can develop arms and legs with the capability of leaving footprints as he walks. An ominous, expressionless mask with grey-violet highlights is painted on his “head” of sorts, and while there is a “mouth” painted on the mask, No-Face has shown that his real, expertly-hidden mouth is larger than the one present on his mask.', movie_id: 1, quote: "Want some gold? I'm not giving it to anyone else.", abilities: 'Can ingest matter in all forms', species: 'Spirit', personality: 'He becomes extremely volatile after being fed.')

Dutiful, kind, and considerate, Sophie also has a tendency to be impulsive in her actions and often feels guilty when she does something wrong, though her attempts to rectify matters are usually disastrous. She also is very compassionate and tries to help others, no matter who they are, going so far as taking the Witch of the Waste under her protection.')

He allowed Michael and Sophie to live with him, and is very forgiving of their mistakes. He also gave Calcifer his heart when Calcifer was a dying falling star. His good traits, however, are masked by his more negative traits, as well as deliberate "blackening of his name", so very few people know of them. He hates to quarrel, and will "slither out" of situations he doesnt want to be in. He hates to be pinned down to anything, and is quite cowardly.')
